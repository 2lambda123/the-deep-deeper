3. **Enter the Title and write a description of the issue**.
Please make sure you write a detailed description of the issue and add an example and the steps to reproduce if possible. If available, we encourage you to attach any images or files that can help us understand and replicate the issue. Here is an example of a good way to [report an issue](https://github.com/the-deep/deeper/issues/297):
4. **Select a label** that properly defines the priority of the issue. Labels help the development team understand the urgency and prioritize the issue accordingly. If it's a critical bug, please assign "High Priority" label to it, if it is non-critical and can wait, assign it "Low Priority".
You can also use labels to categorize issues. For example, you can mark an issue as a bug or a feature request by using appropriate labels. Please go through [this link](https://github.com/the-deep/deeper/labels) to know more about the different labels you can use along with their description.
5. If you know who should work on the issue, please **assign** the name of the team member. If you are not aware of this, please leave it blank.
6. Once you are done, please click **Submit new issue** button.

7. You are done! The development team will now take it from here. Please revisit your issue periodically to keep up with the progress, or if you have email alerts setup you will be notified by email when your issue is updated.
